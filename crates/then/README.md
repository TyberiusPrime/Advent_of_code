The standard library named `bool::then_some` and `bool::then` strangely.
It should have been `then` and `then_with`. I find it annoying that
`expr.then(|| value)` is shorter to type that the more “idiomatic”
`expr.then_some(value)`

This crate provides these functions under the following names
`.some` and `.some_with`.

## Getting started

First, add the crate to your Cargo manifest.

```sh
cargo add then
```

Now bring the trait into scope.

```rust
use then::Some;
```

The `.some` and `.some_with` methods are now available on `bool`.

```rust
assert_eq!(false.some(0), None);
assert_eq!(true.some_with(Default::default), Some(0));
```
