# advent

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions. All in Rust of course!

## Getting started

`cargo run` will run the latest 2020 solution.

To run a specific 2020 solution, just use `cargo run` and pass in the day. The
following will run the solution for 2020 Day 10.

```
cargo run -- 10
```

To run a 2019 solution, specify the package name as well.

```
cargo run --package advent-2019 -- 5
```

All benchmarks can be run with the following.

```
cargo bench
```
