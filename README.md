My ðŸŽ… [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions. Includes a runner
and benchmarker with free Christmas trees ðŸŽ„.

## Getting started

To run a specific solution just use the provided `cargo advent` alias and pass
in the year and day. For example, the following will run the solution for 2020
day 18.

```
cargo advent -y 2020 -d 18 run
```

Tests can be run using the `test` subcommand.

```
cargo advent -y 2020 -d 18 test
```

Benchmarks can be run using the  `bench` subcommand.

```
cargo advent -y 2020 -d 18 bench
```

Extra arguments can be passed to both Cargo and the binary. Arguments after the
first `--` argument will be passed to Cargo and arguments after the second `--`
will be passed to the actual binary. For example if we wanted the JSON output of
the benchmark we could run the following.

```
cargo advent -y 2020 -d 18 bench -- --features=json -- --output json
```

All of the above will be built using `--release`.

### New solutions

Use the following to add a [template](./crates/cli/src/template.rs) for a new
solution. To fetch the input the `ADVENT_SESSION` environment variable needs to
be set which can be extracted from a logged in Advent of Code browser session
under the cookie name "session".

```
cargo advent -y 2022 -d 1 new
```

Open the browser for the given problem

```
cargo advent -y 2020 -d 7 open
```

## Using the runner/benchmarker

You can use the provided runner and benchmarker for your own solutions. To get
started simply add the crate to the Cargo manifest for your solution.
```toml
[dependencies]
advent = { git = "https://github.com/rossmacarthur/advent" }
```

Then use the following as your main function.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut run = advent::with(parse_input);
    run.part(part1);
    run.part(part2);
    run.finish();
}
```

Where
-  `parse_input` is a function that returns any type `I` implementing `Clone`.
- Each part function takes `I` as an argument and returns something implementing
  `Display`.

Ordinary runs of the program will run each part once and print out the output.
Passing `--bench` to your program to perform a benchmark.

That's all! You're free to structure your program however else you want. See
[template.rs](./crates/cli/src/template.rs) for the template I use  or any of
the solutions in this crate for an example.

### Features

There are also some optional features which pull in some other crates:
- **`festive`** enables some festive ascii art and changes the default output to
  `--output festive`
- **`json`** supports JSON output using `--output json`, useful for collecting
  benchmark information
- **`prelude`** re-exports my prelude crate that can be imported using
  ```rust
  use advent::prelude::*;
  ```

They can be enabled like this

```toml
[dependencies]
advent = { git = "https://github.com/rossmacarthur/advent", features = ["festive", "json"] }
```
