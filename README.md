My [ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions. All in Rust of
course ðŸ¦€!

## Getting started

To run a specfic solution just use `cargo run` and pass in the binary name which
consists of the year and the day. For example, the following will run the
solution for 2020 Day 7.

```
cargo run --release --bin 202007
```

Tests can be run in a similar way.

```
cargo test --release --bin 202007
```

Benchmarks can be run by passing `--bench` to the binary.

```
cargo run --release --bin 202007 -- --bench
```
